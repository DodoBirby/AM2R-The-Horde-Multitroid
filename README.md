DISCLAIMER
THIS MOD IS NOT FOR BEGINNERS. 
To complete the game, the player must know how to perform Shinesparks and Ballsparks. Prior completion of AM2R's Fusion mode is also highly recommended. For more challenge, enable Extremely Lethal Mode in Gameplay options on the file select screen.

MULTITROID ADVISORY
The Horde is not compatible with the original AM2R Server. It requires The Horde Server for online funcitonality. 
Multitroid may render a save unable to attain 100% completion if a player joins mid-game. Be sure all players are joined before beginning a match to mitigate this risk.

LANGUAGE DISCLAIMER
The Horde is currently only in English. The original AM2R translations have been included, but don't contain any Horde-specific text entries.
